### Hi there, I'm Zhiwei aka Zee
<p> Hello, I'm a veteran transitioning into the software engineering field. My former experiences in the military has allowed me to thrive under stressful situations and adapt to new and unfamiliar situations. In my former life, I was in the information service field as a mass communication specialist, and I love the creativity that job afforded me.  I'm recently finished studying to be a full stack engineer at Hack Reactor. The program is a 12-week software immersive boot camp designed to develop interpersonal and professional software skills.
I think everyone has an amazing story and would love to hear more about you.
